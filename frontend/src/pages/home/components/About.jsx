                        I'm an Electronic Dance Music (EDM) producer who enjoys exploring sub-genres like
                        <strong> Future Bounce, Future House, Future Bass, and Melodic Dubstep.</strong> I've been passionate
                        about EDM since I was a kid and have always dreamed of making tracks like my inspirations â€”
                        <strong> Martin Garrix, Brooks, Mesto, Skrillex, Mike Williams, and Zedd.</strong>
                        <br /><br />
                        I started creating music using a mobile app called <strong>Music Maker JAM</strong>,
                        where I experimented with loops and made tons of fun tracks. While it was limited,
                        it was the spark that got me started. When I turned 16 and got my first PC, I moved on to
                        <strong> FL Studio</strong>, which I now use as my main DAW to produce music more
                        seriously and creatively.
                        <br /><br />
                        Alongside music, I also have a strong passion for programming. I've been a self-taught
                        coder since 8th grade and have built several websites and apps purely out of curiosity
                        and interest. I love bringing ideas to life and am always looking forward to building
                        new and exciting projects.
